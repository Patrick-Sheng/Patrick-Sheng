<summary><h3>More about me 👨‍💻</h3></summary>

I’ve been programming since I was eight, developing strong problem-solving skills early on through activities like chess and achieving Grade 8 in piano. I value clarity, reliability, and iterative development, preferring small, readable commits and well-tested code. I thrive in collaborative teams where I can lead, share knowledge, and continuously learn new technologies.
